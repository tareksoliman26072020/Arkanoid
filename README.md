# Arkanoid
### Game Structure: + I have main program that opens a window with proper dimensions. + The program have a global ArrayList for storing the blocks. + The ball and the paddle are global variables of this program. + The game starts with a welcoming pabel showing the the controls of the game, and expects the user to press any key to start the game.  + the number of hit blocks and the score is shown while playing. the given score per a hit block depends on how many blocks are being hit before the ball returns to the paddle. The score is calculated with the sum function: $$\stackrel{ball\ is\ back\ to\ the\ paddle}{\underset{i=streak}{\Sigma } i}$$ + The game is won when all blocks are hit/destroyed. Then a new windows is actived, showing the current score, and waiting on the user's input of key 'r' to restart the game. + The game is lost when the ball doesn't meet the paddle when it does down. Then the user's pressed 'r' to restart the game without restarting the program.  ### Paddle and Ball: + objects for the ball and for the paddle.  + Positions are stored as PVector objects. + PVector objects have methods for moving and for drawing,and  methods are called by the main program. + The paddle is controlled by using the keyboard.   ### Bricks: + class Block for a brick's singleton.  + The Block class have functions for drawing and colliding with the ball.  + All Block objects are stored in the main programn's ArrayList in `Arkanoid`. + The collision with the ball work for all four sides of the brick.  + collision detection looks realistic (firework). +  ### Special Bricks: + I have two classes for special bricks 'SlowingBlock'&amp; 'ExplosiveBlock'. both are inherit from the main brick class. + The two classes look different from the main class and both  looks different from each other. + When setting up the list of bricks in the main programm, a certain percentage of bricks should be special bricks.  + The game has in total 177 bricks. 10 of them are of `SlowingBlock`, 10 of them are of `ExplosiveBlock`. ANd because they are inherited of `Block` they can be stored in the same ArrayList of `Block`.  ### Particle System: Whenever a brick is destroyed, a small particle system should display a brick explosion. A class named `Particle` is made for every produced particle in the explosion. This class can be found in the Block's file.  ----  ## Screenshots: ![](https://hackmd.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uploads/upload_5f11e93a39550b63a99a031b90c1bd32.png) ![](https://hackmd.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uploads/upload_79ce3f9dfce3c316e47ec0c874c64df1.png) ![](https://hackmd.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uploads/upload_f1ab023285d6af26f53cc30bf6dc27ab.png) ![](https://hackmd.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uploads/upload_7d56100b95296f4cff258db7ed9d9ba2.png)
